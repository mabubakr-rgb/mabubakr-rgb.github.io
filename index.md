#About

Economic Justice | Inclusive Fintech | Displacement & Human Rights | Data & Strategy for Social Impact 

I’m a Master of Public Policy student at UC Berkeley’s Goldman School, focused on reshaping systems to be more just, inclusive, and grounded in community. My drive for this work comes from my roots as the daughter of Afghan refugees and from lived experience navigating institutions not built for those historically underrepresented in the systems that shape our lives. This perspective fuels my commitment to expanding access to financial systems, protecting human rights, and building tech that works for people—ethically, equitably, and with dignity.

Currently, I’m a Data & Strategy Manager at Discover Santa Clara, where I support strategic initiatives that drive local economic growth through tourism. This role has strengthened my foundation in data analysis, cross-sector collaboration, and community-focused strategy, and I carry those skills into my policy work.

My interests are in inclusive fintech, responsible AI, and the financial empowerment of displaced and historically excluded communities, with a particular interest in the intersections of migration, gender, and economic justice. I'm always open to thoughtful dialogue and collaboration around equity, technology for public good, and research that supports this focus.
